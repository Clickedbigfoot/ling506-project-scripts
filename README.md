As part of your project, you need to maintain a repository of script(s) with documentation on how to replicate your results.

One easy way to do this is to use [ducttape](https://github.com/ExperimentWith/ducttape).

Example scripts (called tapes) and a TUTORIAL.md are in the example-tapes directory.

ducttape is already installed on the qivalluk server at /usr/local/bin/ducttape

If you have trouble getting ducttape to work, you can use simple bash scripts.
